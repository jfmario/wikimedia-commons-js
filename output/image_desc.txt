El Tatio is, at 4,320 meters above sea level, one of the highest-elevation geyser fields in the world. The field has over 80 active geysers, making it the largest geyser field in the southern hemisphere and the third largest in the world (after Yellowstone in the USA and Kronotsky Nature Reserve in Russia).
